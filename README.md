Working project for presentation on Spatial History in HIST205F: Digital History

The question to answer: What was the impact of the 1892 presidential election on party patronage, as measured by the removal of postmasters in each state under Grover Cleveland's new Democratic administration? Did this follow any kind of geographical pattern? Did states that voted for Cleveland experience more or fewer removals than states that did not vote for Cleveland?
